                        <h2>Exploring Mont Blanc: A Trail Runner's Dream</h2>
                        
                        <p>Imagine running through three countries in a single loop—past waterfalls, under glaciers, and through wildflower fields. That's the magic of the Mont Blanc Loop, or Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB), a roughly 100-mile trail that circles Western Europe’s tallest peak. It's tough—about 30,000 feet of elevation gain—but unforgettable. “It felt like I was running through a dream,” says Nora Li, a trail runner from Vancouver who completed the loop solo last July. “I cried at the top of Col de la Seigne. Not because I was tired, but because it was so beautiful.” Each day on the loop brings something new: steep climbs, silent ridgelines, and valleys dotted with bell-wearing cows.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>One of the best parts? You don't have to carry a tent or cook your own food. The route is lined with mountain refuges—cozy huts where runners can sleep, eat a hot meal, and even grab a morning espresso. “It's luxury trail running,” laughs Tom Dubois, a UTMB qualifier who's done the loop twice. Tip: book refuges early (especially in August), and pack light—many runners carry just a vest with water, snacks, and an extra layer. Trail shoes with good grip are a must, and trekking poles can save your quads on long descents.</p>

                        <p>For peak trail conditions, go between late June and early September. Early summer means lush green meadows and fewer crowds, while late August draws elite athletes from around the world for the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc—a 100-mile race that follows the same loop. But you don't need a bib to feel like a champion here. “Finishing the TMB was the proudest moment of my running life,” says Nora. “You come back with stronger legs, a fuller heart, and stories you'll tell forever.” </p>
